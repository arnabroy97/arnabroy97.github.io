👋 Hello and welcome!  
I’m **Arnab Roy**, a graduate student researcher working with interested in the physics of living systems. My work focuses on understanding how **mechanics, geometry, and active processes** drive organization and pattern formation in biological and bio-inspired systems.

Broadly, my research interests include:

- Active force driven shape change
- Biophysics of cytoskeletal systems    
- Geometry and mechanics in living systems
- Cells in elastic network
- Tissue morphogenesis
- Nonlinear dynamics and pattern formation  

I am currently pursuing my **PhD in Physics at UC Merced**, where I am part of the **BioSoft Theory Group** working with **Prof. Kinjal Dasbiswas**. I am interested in soft active matter theory, particularly I am currently working on active mechanical force driven shape change in contractile poroelastic actomyosin gels.

Before this, I was part of the **Theoretical and Physical Biology (TPBG) Group** at **IISER Kolkata** where I worked with **Dr. Dipjyoti Das** on stochastic gene expression. Prior to that I completed my **BS-MS** from **IISER Bhopal**.

Beyond science, I enjoy **reading story books**, watching cricket and football,cooking and trying new food,hiking, watching mystery thriller shows and learning new skills.

Thanks for stopping by — feel free to connect!
